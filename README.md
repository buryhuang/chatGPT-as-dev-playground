# ChatGPT Development Repository for Developers

Hello, developers! Welcome to the ChatGPT Development Repository, specially designed for those who are new to working with OpenAI's ChatGPT. This repository contains a collection of system roles and instructions that can be sent to ChatGPT to create various programs in different domains, such as Python, Frontend, Blockchain, and Zero-Knowledge Proofs (ZKP). Our goal is to provide a set of easy-to-understand resources that help you communicate effectively with the ChatGPT model and develop custom applications.

## Instruction Files

The repository contains the following markdown files:

1. **automating_jira_to_google_sheets_as_python_dev.md** - This file has instructions and system roles for guiding ChatGPT to create a Python program that automates fetching data from Jira and updating a Google Sheets document.

2. **create_chatgpt_webapp_as_frontend_dev.md** - In this file, you'll find instructions and system roles for working with ChatGPT to develop a web application that leverages the ChatGPT model.

3. **create_nft_smartcontract_as_blockchain_dev.md** - Here, you'll discover a set of instructions and system roles to help you work with ChatGPT to create a non-fungible token (NFT) smart contract on a blockchain platform.

4. **create_zkp_for_art_as_zkp_dev.md** - This file provides instructions and system roles for guiding ChatGPT to develop a zero-knowledge proof (ZKP) application for digital art.

## Using ChatGPT Playground Interface

To use these instructions with ChatGPT, you can access the [ChatGPT Playground](https://platform.openai.com/playground) provided by OpenAI. The Playground is an interactive web-based interface that allows you to experiment with ChatGPT by sending instructions and receiving generated responses.

### Steps to use ChatGPT Playground:

1. Sign in to your OpenAI account or create a new account if you don't have one.

2. Navigate to the [ChatGPT Playground](https://platform.openai.com/playground).

3. Select the Mode "Chat" on the right, choose desired ChatGPT model, such as "gpt-3.5-turbo".

4. Provide the system role and instruction(s) from the repository files as input. You can either type or copy-paste the content into the Playground's input box.

5. Click "Submit" or press Enter to send the instruction to ChatGPT.

6. Wait for the model to generate a response based on the provided context. You can then use the generated code or information to develop your desired application or program.

Feel free to explore and experiment with the instructions in the repository files. Happy coding!
