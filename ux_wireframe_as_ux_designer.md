Create 3 pages.

First page:
Title: Global parameters settings
The purpose of the page is to configure the parameters for the following data:
\`\`\`
    "range_params": [
        {
            "range": {
                "start": "0",
                "end": "0.2499"
            },
            "DispensingFee": "4.00",
            "Adjustment": "0.92",
        },
        {
            "range": {
                "start": "0.25",
                "end": "0.4999"
            },
            "DispensingFee": "4.00",
            "Adjustment": "00.93",
        }
     ]
\`\`\`


```


```
Make the inputs grounded with no duplications.
Make the "Dispensing Fee" showing display unit of currency as USD
Make the Adjustment showing as percentage
```


```
Change it to use row baed layout. User can add or remove some row of the parameters
```
