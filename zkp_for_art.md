# ZK Circuit Spec
Here is the spec for a smart contract and circuit created by halo2, used to to validate the list of artist referenced by a AI generated image using zero-knowledge proof
- The circuit will intake a list of artists and a A.I. model
- The circuit will create a zero knowledge proof with any given image
- The circuit will create an smart contract to be execute on Ethereum to validate any given image with raw bytes


## General Smart Contract
General Use Case:

The smart contract and circuit created using Halo2 will be used to validate the list of artists referenced by an AI-generated image using zero-knowledge proof. This will be helpful in ensuring that the model used to generate the image is not biased towards certain artists or genres of art. By validating the list of artists, we can ensure a fair and unbiased approach to AI-generated art.

Interface and Acceptance Criteria:

The smart contract and circuit will take in two inputs:
- A list of artists
- An AI model

The circuit will create a zero-knowledge proof with any given image and create a smart contract to be executed on Ethereum to validate any given image with raw bytes.

The acceptance criteria for the smart contract and circuit are as follows:
- The circuit should be able to validate the list of artists referenced by an AI-generated image using zero-knowledge proof.
- The smart contract should be able to execute on Ethereum to validate any given image with raw bytes.
- The smart contract should be secure and free from vulnerabilities.

Here is an example implementation of the smart contract in Solidity:

```
pragma solidity ^0.8.0;

contract ArtistValidation {
    bytes32 private hash;
    mapping (address => bool) private validated;

    constructor(bytes32 _hash) {
        hash = _hash;
    }

    function validate(bytes memory image) public {
        require(!validated[msg.sender], "Artist has already validated this image.");
        bytes32 imageHash = keccak256(image);
        require(imageHash == hash, "Image hash does not match.");
        validated[msg.sender] = true;
    }

    function isValidationComplete() public view returns (bool) {
        for (address artist : artists) {
            if (!validated[artist]) {
                return false;
            }
        }
        return true;
    }
}
```

In this implementation, the `ArtistValidation` contract takes in a hash of the image, which is used to validate the image. The `validate` function takes in the raw bytes of the image and checks if the hash matches the one provided during contract creation. If the hash matches, the artist's address is added to the `validated` mapping to indicate that they have validated the image.

The `isValidationComplete` function checks if all artists in the list have validated the image by checking if their addresses exist in the `validated` mapping. If all artists have validated the image, the function returns `true`.

Note that this implementation is just an example and may need to be modified based on the specific requirements of the use case.


## The Halo2 Circuit
Create the circuit using ZK framework Halo2

To create the circuit using ZK framework Halo2, we first need to define the constraints and variables involved in the validation process. Here is an example of how we can define the circuit:

```
use halo2::{
    circuit::{Layouter, SimpleFloorPlanner},
    plonk::{Circuit, ConstraintSystem, Error, Selector},
    poly::Rotation,
    sigma::SigmaBoolean,
    transcript::Transcript,
};
use pasta_curves::pallas::Affine;
use std::marker::PhantomData;

// Define the circuit struct
pub struct ArtistValidationCircuit {
    hash: [u8; 32],
    image: Vec<u8>,
    artists: Vec<Affine>,
}

// Define the circuit implementation
impl Circuit<pasta_curves::pallas::Scalar> for ArtistValidationCircuit {
    fn synthesize<CS: ConstraintSystem<pasta_curves::pallas::Scalar>>(
        &self,
        cs: &mut CS,
    ) -> Result<(), Error> {
        // Define the selectors
        let image_selector =
            Selector::new("image", Rotation::cur(), self.image.len() * 8).unwrap();
        let artist_selectors = self
            .artists
            .iter()
            .enumerate()
            .map(|(i, _)| Selector::new(format!("artist_{}", i), Rotation::cur(), 256).unwrap())
            .collect::<Vec<_>>();

        // Allocate the variables
        let image_var = cs.allocate(&image_selector)?;
        let artist_vars = artist_selectors
            .iter()
            .map(|selector| cs.allocate(selector))
            .collect::<Result<Vec<_>, _>>()?;

        // Constrain the image variable
        for (i, byte) in self.image.iter().enumerate() {
            for j in 0..8 {
                cs.constrain(image_var.extract_bit(Rotation::cur(), i * 8 + j) - (*byte >> j & 1u8));
            }
        }

        // Constrain the artist variables
        for (i, artist) in self.artists.iter().enumerate() {
            let sigma = SigmaBoolean::from_affine(artist.clone());
            let selector = artist_selectors[i];
            cs.constrain(selector.clone().bit() - sigma.expr());
        }

        // Constrain the hash variable
        let hash_var = cs.constant_boolean_array(&self.hash[..]);

        // Require that the hash of the image matches the provided hash
        let hash_check_var = hash_var
            .iter()
            .zip(image_var.iter())
            .fold(Ok(cs.constant(Boolean::TRUE)))(
                |acc, (hash_bit, image_bit)| Ok(acc? & (hash_bit? ^ image_bit?))
            )?;
        cs.constrain(hash_check_var);

        Ok(())
    }
}
```

In this implementation, we define the `ArtistValidationCircuit` struct which contains the hash of the image, the raw bytes of the image, and the list of artists represented as affine points. We then define the `synthesize` function which takes in a `ConstraintSystem` and allocates variables for the image and artist selectors. We then constrain the image and artist variables to ensure that they match the provided image and artists, respectively. Finally, we constrain the hash variable to ensure that the hash of the image matches the provided hash.

Note that this implementation is just an example and may need to be modified based on the specific requirements of the use case. Also, this circuit should be combined with a proof system, such as PLONK, to create a zero-knowledge proof.


## Creating the proof
Create the halo2 commands to create proof and solidity smart contract

To create a proof using Halo2, we need to first create an instance of the circuit and then generate a proof using a transcript. Here is an example of how we can create the proof:

```
use halo2::{
    circuit::SimpleFloorPlanner,
    plonk::{Circuit, Prover, Verifier},
    transcript::Transcript,
};

// Create an instance of the circuit
let circuit = ArtistValidationCircuit {
    hash: [0u8; 32],
    image: vec![0u8; 1024],
    artists: vec![Affine::prime_from_bytes(&[0u8; 32]).unwrap(); 10],
};

// Generate a proof
let prover = Prover::new(&circuit, &[], SimpleFloorPlanner::new());
let mut transcript = Transcript::new(b"ArtistValidation");
let proof = prover.prove(&mut transcript)?;
```

In this implementation, we create an instance of the `ArtistValidationCircuit` struct and then use a `Prover` to generate a proof. We create a new `Transcript` to use for the proof, and then call the `prove` function on the `Prover` instance to generate the proof.

To create a Solidity smart contract using the proof, we need to define the contract interface and implementation. Here is an example of how we can define the contract:

```
pragma solidity ^0.8.0;

contract ArtistValidation {
    bytes32 private hash;
    mapping (address => bool) private validated;

    constructor(bytes32 _hash) {
        hash = _hash;
    }

    function validate(bytes memory image, uint256[] memory proof) public {
        require(!validated[msg.sender], "Artist has already validated this image.");

        // Verify the proof
        require(verifyProof(image, proof), "Invalid proof.");

        validated[msg.sender] = true;
    }

    function isValidationComplete() public view returns (bool) {
        for (address artist : artists) {
            if (!validated[artist]) {
                return false;
            }
        }
        return true;
    }

    function verifyProof(bytes memory image, uint256[] memory proof) private view returns (bool) {
        // TODO: Verify the proof using the Halo2 library
        return true;
    }
}
```

In this implementation, we define a `validate` function which takes in the raw bytes of the image and the proof generated by the Halo2 library. We verify the proof using the `verifyProof` function, and if the proof is valid, we add the artist's address to the `validated` mapping. We then define an `isValidationComplete` function which checks if all artists have validated the image.

Note that the `verifyProof` function is not yet implemented and will need to be modified to use the Halo2 library to verify the proof. Once the `verifyProof` function is implemented, the Solidity smart contract can be deployed to the Ethereum blockchain to validate AI-generated images using zero-knowledge proof.
